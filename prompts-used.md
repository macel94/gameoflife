using vite latest version and typescript, build the very famous conway's game of life. i want a 1024x768 grid, and a button to randomly initialize the grid, another button to clear the grid, another one to start the game.

use typescript for all the logic, and use a single file for the game logic.

the code should be very optimized, because i want an fps counter and want to see it go at least at 60fps



--------------------


fps are around 35.
can't this go faster?

--------------------
yes, the fps now shows 61.

but why 61 and not 120? is this really the most that we can achieve?

You've hit on a very important point! The reason you're seeing ~61 FPS is because of how web browsers handle animations. The requestAnimationFrame function, which we're using to create the game loop, synchronizes with your monitor's refresh rate. Most monitors have a 60Hz refresh rate, meaning they can only display 60 new frames per second. This is a good thing for visual animations, as it prevents screen tearing and saves CPU resources by not rendering frames that would never be seen.

However, you're right to ask if the simulation itself can run faster. It can! We can decouple the game logic (calculating the next generation) from the rendering logic (drawing the grid).

I can modify the code to run as many simulation steps as possible between each frame that is drawn to the screen. We can then change the "FPS" counter to a "Generations Per Second" (GPS) counter to accurately measure the raw computational speed of the simulation. The visual update on your screen will still be capped by your monitor's refresh rate, but we'll see how fast the underlying logic can truly run.

Would you like me to make that change?

-----------------------------

but what if i didn't want to use requestAnimationFrame and just wanted to output as soon as possible?

-----------

it's still only around 64 generations per second.

----------

it's now 130 generations per second!

but is this the maximum possible?

it now suggests writing rust code and compiling it to wasm for performance improvements.
