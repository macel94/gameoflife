using vite latest version and typescript, build the very famous conway's game of life. i want a 1024x768 grid, and a button to randomly initialize the grid, another button to clear the grid, another one to start the game.

use typescript for all the logic, and use a single file for the game logic.

the code should be very optimized, because i want an fps counter and want to see it go at least at 60fps



--------------------


fps are around 35.
can't this go faster?
